[[./me.jpeg]]

I am Ankit Kumar, a fifth year PhD student working with [[https://www.ccs.neu.edu/~pete/][Prof. Pete
Manolios]] at [[https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu][Khoury College, Northeastern University]]. My research
interests lie in Formal Methods, Theorem Proving and Disproving,
Decision Procedures, Programming Languages and Distributed systems.

In my free time, I like to dabble in astrophotography as well as play
chess and tabletennis.

* Publications
 # ** [[][Formal Model-Driven Analysis of Resilience of GossipSub to Sybil Attacks]]
** [[./stuff/MPMS-fmcad-2021.pdf][Mathematical Programming Modulo Strings]]
   
   The key idea is a sound, complete and terminating transition system
   TranSeq for the existential theory of string equations which,
   instead of using a SAT solver as a backend, uses a LIA solver to
   guide search for a solution.

* Talks
** Caraxes: Tracking Critical Data in the Cloud
<2022-09-02 Fri> End of internship talk where Drew and I showed how to "lift" taint
analysis from code level to cloud level, and also demoed a
prototype tool we developed called Caraxes. The slides and video of
this talk are available in the Amazon internal network.
** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doeauZv3JrE][Mathematical Programming Modulo Strings]] (Invited Talk at Boston Computational Club)
<2021-10-15 Fri> Talked about my first FMCAD paper on Mathematical
Programming Modulo Strings.
** [[./stuff/ATOC.pdf][Automated Grading of Automata with ACL2s]]
<2022-07-11 Mon> Talk on automatic grading and feedback generation for
Theory of Computation assignments using the ACL2s theorem prover,
during [[https://www.uc.pt/en/congressos/thedu/ThEdu21/postproceedings][ThEdu '21]].
** [[./stuff/APLnotes.pdf][History of Rank Polymorphic Type Systems in Array Programming Languages]]
Lecture notes for a seminar on type systems for array programming
languages covering APL, implicit scaling, Haskell and Remora.
** [[./stuff/DTProofAsst.pdf][Dependently Typed Proof Assistants]]
Lecture notes for a seminar on the implementation of dependently typed proof
assistants, comparing and contrasting NuPRL and Coq proof assistants.

* Teaching
I have been a TA for the following courses: Algorithms (A), Logic and
Computation (LC), Theory of Computation (TC) and Computer Aided
Reasoning (CAR).
