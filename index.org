I am Ankit Kumar, a fifth year PhD student working with
[[https://www.ccs.neu.edu/~pete/][Prof. Panagiotis Manolios]] at [[https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu][Khoury College, Northeastern University]]. My research
interests lie in Formal Methods, Theorem Proving and Disproving,
Decision Procedures, Programming Languages and Distributed systems.

In my free time, I like to dabble in astrophotography as well as play
chess and tabletennis.
